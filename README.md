I implemented a data extraction system using Regular Expressions (regex) to identify and extract specific types of information from a block of text.  It effectively validates and isolates emails, URLs, phone numbers, currency amounts and credit card numbers from a text string.

The first task handled was extracting email addresses. A regex pattern was defined to match the standard structure of email addresses, which includes a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters before and after the '@' symbol, ending with a domain extension like '.com. The re.findall() function was then used to scan through the text and extract every occurrence of a string that fits the email pattern.
Next, the code focused on extracting URLs. A regex pattern was crafted to detect web addresses that start with either http or https followed by :// and a series of characters until a space is encountered. Again, the re.findall() function was applied to the text to collect all matches of this URL pattern. This is useful for filtering out all links in a large text.
For phone number extraction, a regex pattern was written to recognize multiple common phone number formats such as (123) 456-7890, 123-456-7890, and 123.456.7890. The pattern accommodates different separators like dashes, dots, and parentheses to ensure it captures various possible representations of phone numbers. The re.findall() function was then used to retrieve all phone numbers from the text based on this pattern.
Lastly, the code handled the extraction of credit card numbers. The regex pattern was designed to match the typical format of a 16-digit credit card number, which could be separated either by spaces or hyphens every four digits. Using re.findall(), the code scanned the text and collected all occurrences of strings that fit this pattern. This kind of validation ensures that any text data containing credit card numbers can be identified and processed or secured appropriately.
